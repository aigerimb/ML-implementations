# ML-implementations
This repository contains implementations of  some of ML models. 


This repository contains the following list of implementations and datasets.

1. neural_network_from_scratch.py builds from scratch a multilayer neural network for a multi-class classification problem. 
The script does not use any ready libraries and performs backpropagation for training. It uses "Image_Segmentaion.csv" file for training, the description of which can be found in "Image_Segmentaton_Description.pdf".
